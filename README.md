In this challenge we created table headers for CSV files we then imported.
We created an Entity Relationship Diagram between our tables.
Then we used SQL queries to answer specific questions about the databases we'd created.
My ERD & table schema were created in QuickDBD, then imported into pgAdmin.
I used resources from Stack Overflow and YouTube to better understand ERDs.
I used in-class examples on JOIN, WHERE, and GROUP BY to write my queries.
